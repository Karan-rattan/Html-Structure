Welcome to my web application project! I used HTML and GitHub and some css to create a user-friendly website, and it was quite a journey.

## What Went Well

- **Learning HTML:** I gained a solid understanding of HTML, which boosted my confidence in front-end development.
- **Using GitHub:** Managing my code with GitHub was a game-changer. I loved tracking changes and collaborating with others.
- **Responsive Design:** Implementing responsive design was rewarding, as I saw the site adapt beautifully to different devices.
- **Community Feedback:** Sharing my work on GitHub brought valuable insights from peers, helping me refine my code.

## Challenges Faced

- **Learning Curve:** Grasping the intricacies of HTML and CSS was tough at first, but persistence paid off.
- **Debugging:** Debugging responsive design issues was frustrating, requiring lots of testing across devices.
- **Time Management:** Balancing this project with other commitments was tricky; I learned to set realistic goals.
- **Feature Integration:** Integrating features like forms took more effort than expected, but it was a great learning experience.
